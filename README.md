In need of extra screen space? Having two monitors or multiple monitors increases productivity by expanding the amount of on-screen space. In this guide, we will walk you through all the required steps that will get you started with your dual monitor setup.

### Gathering the Hardware

The best way to set up your dual monitor setup is highly dependent on how your monitors connect and on the ports on your laptop/desktop. It’s very important that you take your computer ports into account before you buy a second monitor. This will save you from having to spend extra money on an additional adapter.

Start by inspecting your computer’s video ports and see what you’re working with. See if you can set up the connection without an adapter. However, you might not have a choice.

For example, if you want the second screen to be your old VGA monitor, you’ll likely need an adapter like this one in order to connect it to the HDMI port of a new laptop. Likewise, if you have an old DVI monitor, you’ll need an adapter of this kind in order to plug it into an HDMI port.

Most laptops come with multiple video ports. Let’s take the popular Dell Latitude E6230. It contains one 19-pin HDMI connector and one VGA connector. Looking at these options, one monitor can be hooked up to the HDMI port and the other one to the VGA port.

Desktops, on the other hand, have a built-in VGA on the motherboard and multiple HDMI and DVI ports on the dedicated graphics card. This is why desktops are ideal for dual monitor setups.

In case you only have one port (VGA, HDMI, or DVI), you will need a dual adapter. If the port is VGA, you’ll need a Monitor VGA dual splitter. If your port is DVI and your two monitors are both VGA, you’ll need a DVI-I Analog to 2x VGA Video Splitter Cable. But keep in mind that this is not ideal since it will only duplicate the display – won’t work with the Extend mode.

## How to Connect Two Monitors With HDMI?

* First, you’ll need two monitors capable of using HDMI. The good news is that nearly every monitor supports HDMI these days. You’ll also need an HDMI cable long enough to reach from the first monitor to the second. This could range anywhere from three feet to 10 feet, depending on how easy it is to route the cable along with your desk.
* Then, once you have your monitors connected via an HDMI cable, open your computer’s display settings and set up mirroring on both displays. This will let your laptop send the same image to both monitors.
* At this point, you can close the display settings and connect your monitors directly to your computer via DVI-D (the stable connection). Since DVI works like VGA (an analog plug), you can connect two monitors like any other pair of computer displays.
* The final step is setting the monitor resolutions in the monitor’s settings menu in Windows 7 or Windows 8. This lets you choose which screen your computer sends to each monitor so that it looks just right when it’s displayed on both screens at once.

## Set the Primary & Secondary Monitor

* Right-click on your desktop and select "Display". At the top of the resulting dialogue box, your available monitors appear as blue, numbered boxes. Each box represents a monitor (e.g. box "1" corresponds with the left monitor and box "2" corresponds with the right monitor).
* From the display, select the monitor you wish to be your main display.
* Check the box that says "Make this my main display." The other monitor will automatically become the secondary display.
* When finished, click [Apply].
